# Bike Shop

This repo is for a recreation of a Bike Shop website that was done during my degree at Full Sail University.
For this project, I was given only reference images of the finished site and tasked to recreate it to the best of my abilities using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any other third party frameworks or libraries.

The reference photos can be found in the [design folder](https://github.com/wfahnestock/wfahnestock.github.io/tree/master/design). 
[BikeShop.jpg](https://github.com/wfahnestock/wfahnestock.github.io/blob/master/design/BikeShop.jpg) was the initial completed design I was given the task of recreating, as well as the [style guide](https://github.com/wfahnestock/wfahnestock.github.io/blob/master/design/styleguide.jpg) for the design of the site.

In addition to the reference photo, I was tasked with finding my own inspiration for designs that I wanted to implement into my version of the completed site.
