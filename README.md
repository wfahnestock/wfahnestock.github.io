This repo is for my Designing for Web Standards I class at Full Sail University.

## Repo Files
The HTML file [homepage.html](https://github.com/wfahnestock/wfahnestock.github.io/blob/master/homepage.html) is my recreation of the composite on my own, independent from the course material. This file contains all of the CSS that I have currently finished. You can view the page [here](https://wfahnestock.github.io/homepage.html).
